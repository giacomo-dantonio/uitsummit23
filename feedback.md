## Dry Run @ Synera

Slide Levels - typo at Individual Contributors

Personal: 1-2 anecdotes of your own stories
Start with a small story. 

Different levels: Give an example for a task
Go over the skill descriptions a bit faster and focus more on the second part

Maybe: “What about us” - earlier: for each aspect of the working interactions, connect back to this main aspect
	⁃	Reka: Choose the company wisely: how to do that? What to look for? What questions to ask, maybe in the interview process, or at conferences

Presentation Style
	⁃	I saw you looking at the slides a lot. 
	⁃	You will probably have a screen with your slides in front of you, stay as much as possible facing the audience. 
	⁃	Good gesticulation and expression
